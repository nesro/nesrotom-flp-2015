Find two shortests edge disjoint paths in a graph. C, Lisp and Prolog
=====================================================================

There are few bugs in the source code comments and some things can be improved (reversing path in prolog is not mandatory).
The Lisp soltution works exactly the same as in C (so the Lisp code is very bad and should be rewritten).
I will fix it when I will have cycles. If you want to explain something, feel free to contact me.

Please note that this is my school project for the MI-FLP (functional and logic programming) class.
Do not use it as your own!

Tests from edux are ok. You can check it:

	$ ./test.sh 
	c compile: OK
	c test: OK
	lisp test: OK
	prolog test 1: OK
	prolog test 2: OK
	prolog test 3: OK
	prolog test 4: OK
	prolog test all: OK
